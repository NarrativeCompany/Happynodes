# NGD's London Hackathon 2018

F27 took part of NEO Global Development's first London Hackathon on 17th June 2018. The hackathon was organised by NGD with the goal to help participants LEARN, THINK and CREATE on NEO's Smart Economy platform.

This specific challenge centred around Network State Monitoring.

For us, this was a series of firsts: our first NEO meetup, our first hackathon as Team F27, and the first time we published a live App to an audience from F27.

Since this was a time sensitive hackathon, please excuse our early commits around code quality. We focused on making resilient, fully working functionality which we achieved.

Our Innovations:
- New Health Scoring system taking into account 4 metrics to provide differentiation between Online Nodes
- Unconfirmed Transactions explorer - see how many nodes are supporting the as-yet unconfirmed transactions
- Graph explorer to show the connections for the network as well as the direct edges for each Node

Developed by F27 crew:

# Notes on F27 Ventures
F27 was started by a group of 27-year olds who wanted to change the world one code commit at a time. We've worked at startups, large corporates and gone freelance. You don't have to be 27 to be part of our journey, you just need to dig what we do.
